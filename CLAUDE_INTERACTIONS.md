## Session: 2026-01-21

### Interaction 1: Refactor Net Assignments UI
**User Prompt:**
Implement the following plan:
- Remove the standalone "Add New Assignment" form
- Add an inline "add row" as the first row of the assignments table
- Move the filter input to be smaller and positioned to the right of "Current NET:" indicator

**Claude Actions:**
- Updated `ncs-net-assignments.html` to create flex header with title left, filter right
- Removed the `form-and-autocomplete-wrapper` section
- Added inline input fields in the table as the first row using `isAddRow` flag
- Updated `ncs-net-assignments.css` with new styles for header-row, filter-input, add-row
- Updated `ncs-net-assignments.ts` to include addRowPlaceholder in data source and configure filter/sort to handle it

---

### Interaction 2: Keep Add Row at Top of Table
**User Prompt:**
Please put the row where a new person is added on the top of the table. That way when lots of people are added the row to add the next person is always on top.

**Claude Actions:**
- Modified `configureSorting()` in `ncs-net-assignments.ts` to override `sortData` function
- The add row is now always kept at the top regardless of sorting applied to other rows

---

### Interaction 3: Arrow Key Navigation for Autocomplete
**User Prompt:**
Make the arrows keys work to change which call sign is currently selected. CTRL-P and up arrow should move up and CTRL-N and down arrow should move down. Already pressing tab enters the selected call sign -- that is good; please keep that.

**Claude Actions:**
- Updated `onCallsignKeydown()` in `ncs-net-assignments.ts` to handle ArrowUp and ArrowDown keys in addition to Ctrl+P and Ctrl+N

---

### Interaction 4: Focus Add Button After Tab Selection
**User Prompt:**
When I press tab to copy the selected callsign from the partial match list into the table, make the `+` column selected so I can just press return to add them.

**Claude Actions:**
- Added `ElementRef` injection to the component constructor
- Updated `selectOperator()` to focus the add button after selecting an operator using `querySelector('.add-row button')`

---

### Interaction 5: Firebase Deploy Issue
**User Prompt:**
`npm run deploy` fails. Fix it

**Claude Actions:**
- Diagnosed the issue: `.firebaserc` file is in `.gitignore` and not present
- Explained that this is a local Firebase configuration issue, not a code issue
- Provided solution: run `firebase use --add` or `firebase use <project-id>`

---

### Interaction 6: Clock Styling - Red Bold Font
**User Prompt:**
Make the clock's numbers be red and a bold font.

**Claude Actions:**
- Updated `.clock` class in `ncs-top-bar.css` to add `color: red` and `font-weight: 700`

---

### Interaction 7: Clock Styling - Black Background and Larger Font
**User Prompt:**
Give the rectangle around the clock a black background so the contrast with the red font is easier to read. Make the font size of the clock's numbers 20% larger.

**Claude Actions:**
- Updated `.clock` class to add `background-color: black`, `padding: 4px 8px`, `border-radius: 4px`
- Increased font-size from 16px to 19px (20% larger)
- Updated media query font-size from 14px to 17px

---

### Interaction 8: Time In Field Default to "now"
**User Prompt:**
In the data entry row (the first row) the Time in field should start with the placeholder `now` -- if the user does not manually entry the time, when the click the add button the time that is currently displayed by the clock (the current time) is used for the time in field.

**Claude Actions:**
- Updated `initializeForm()` to initialize timeIn as empty string instead of current time
- Changed the timeIn input from `type="time"` to `type="text"` with placeholder "now"
- Updated `addAssignment()` to use current time if timeIn is empty

---

### Interaction 9: Focus Callsign After Adding
**User Prompt:**
After clicking the add button put the focus back into the callsign field. This will allow the user to keep their hands on the keyboard more.

**Claude Actions:**
- Added `focusCallsignInput()` method that queries for the callsign input in the add row
- Called this method after successfully adding an assignment

---

### Interaction 10: Create View 2 Page

1. Callsign, 2. First Name, 3. Last Name, 4. Class Box A, 5. Class Box B, 6. WTR, 7. Class Box D, 8. Class Box E, 9. Class Box F, 10. Class Box G, 11. Class Box H, 12. Header name, 13. Footer info

Like the `Current Net` view it will display the name of the net near the top, and have a filter in a similar position. The first row of the table can be used to enter a new person. Each row can be individually deleted or edited. Each column may be hidden.

**Claude Actions:**

2. One can use the up and down arrows (or CTRL-N / CTRL-P) to go to the next or previous item in the list of matching callsigns.
3. pressing tab enters the selected callsign and places the focus on the Add button in the actions column

**Claude Actions:**
- Added `OperatorService` and `Operator` model imports to `ncs-view2.ts`
- Added operator-related properties: `operators`, `filteredOperators`, `selectedOperatorIndex`, `autocompleteOffset`, `selectedCallsignAlreadyAdded`

**Claude Actions:**
- Created unified data model `src/app/_models/net-entry.model.ts` combining all fields from both views

---

### Interaction 15: Track Check-in Time in View 2
**User Prompt:**
Even when someone is entered using `view 2` still track the time they checked in.

**Claude Actions:**

- Now entries added from View 2 automatically record the check-in time, which will be visible in NET Assignments

---

### Interaction 16: Compact and Responsive Tables
**User Prompt:**
Make the tables in both ncs-view and ncs-net-assignments route have less blank space. Use a `...` or bento box icon to choose the action (checkout, edit, delete) instead of having three icons. Make columns like `Milage Start` and others only as wide as they need to be. It's important that the application is responsive and looks good on a computer, tablet, or phone.

### Interaction 17: Default Duty and Classification to Previous Values
**User Prompt:**
In the `ncs-net-assignments` route, when a person is checked in the duty and classification should default to what they were for the person checked in right before them.

**Claude Actions:**
- Added `lastClassification` property initialized to 'observer'
- Updated `initializeForm()` to use `this.lastClassification` instead of hardcoded 'observer'
- Updated `addAssignment()` to save the classification value to `lastClassification` (duty was already being saved to `lastDuty`)
- Now both duty and classification default to the values from the previous check-in

---

### Interaction 18: Add Build Date and Git Commit Hash to About Page
**User Prompt:**
Please put the build date and git commit hash in the `/ncs-about` route so I can know which version of the program is in use.

**Claude Actions:**
- Created `scripts/generate-version.js` that extracts git hash and build date
- Updated `package.json` to add `prebuild` and `prestart` scripts that run the version generator
- Added `/src/environments/version.ts` to `.gitignore` since it's auto-generated
- Updated `ncs-about.ts` to import versionInfo and format the build date
- Updated `ncs-about.html` to display the build date and git commit hash
- Added styling for the version info section in `ncs-about.css`

### Interaction 19: Sync members.json to Firebase people Collection
**User Prompt:**
Right now `members.json` is used to populate the internal database used for callsign and name matching. Instead, use `members.json` as one way to add people to the `people` document in firestore's realtime database. If a person exists in `members.json` but not in the `people` document add them to the `people` document. If someone exists in people but not `members.json` take no action -- just log it to the console.

- Added to `firebase.service.ts`:
  - `getPeople()` - Observable to get people from Firebase `people` collection
  - `getPeopleOnce()` - Promise-based one-time fetch for sync operations
  - `addPerson()` - Add a person to the Firebase `people` collection
- Updated `operator.service.ts`:
  - Changed `getOperators()` to return data from Firebase instead of members.json
  - Added `syncMembersToFirebase()` method that runs on service initialization
  - Sync logic: adds anyone from members.json not in Firebase
  - Logs anyone in Firebase but not in members.json (no deletion)
  - Uses callsign as the unique identifier (case-insensitive comparison)

---
